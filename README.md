Not everyone agrees that health care is a human right, but we can all agree that it is a human necessity. You're going to need it eventually. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life. Our society is wealthy and innovative enough to enusre a minimum level of necessary care for all citizens, while rewarding those who serve their community by providing that care.
