# A BILL

## To establish a Medical Corps in the Department of Health and Human Services.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,

WHEREAS all people have the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;

WHEREAS sickness, disease and the financial burdens of private health care pose a direct threat to these rights;

WHEREAS it is the role of the Federal Government to provide for the common defense and promote the general welfare of the people;

WHEREAS it is the duty of the people to uphold and defend these rights;

WHEREAS the existing systems of subsidized private health insurance, Medicare and Medicaid are fiscally unsustainable;

WHEREAS the cost of medical education has a significant negative impact on the availability of health care services;

WHEREAS the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) operates one of the largest health care systems in the world and currently provides training for a majority of the Nation's medical, nursing and allied health professionals;

WHEREAS the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system currently includes 152 hospitals, 800 community-based outpatient clinics, 126 nursing home care units and 35 domiciliaries.

WHEREAS the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps (PHSCC) was established to protect, promote, and advance the health and safety of the Nation through leadership and service;

This bill would establish a Medical Corps in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which would be an all-volunteer corps similar in organizational structure to the military, in which members hold a rank with a corresponding paygrade. Members of the Medical Corps would be provided medical education and training at no cost to the member, in exchange for a commitment to provide health care services to the public at no cost to the patient.

SECTION 1: The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) will be renamed Medical Corps (HHSMC) and its parent agency will be changed from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). To the extent that is possible, all existing VHA facilities, infrastructure, and personnel will remain unchanged.

The existing role of Under Secretary of Veterans Affairs for Health will become the new Assistant Secretary for Individual Health, and the existing role of Assistant Secretary for Health will be renamed Assistant Secretary for Public Health to avoid ambiguity.
